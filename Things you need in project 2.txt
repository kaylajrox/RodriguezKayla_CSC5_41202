Add Back:
while loop

In Writeup
Big table					
from each chapter what we learned and where     Add to current Writeup
to find it in your code
(check writeup examples for project 1)

Final:
1.int-->unsigned int eqivalent
2.did this in class 1-1000 guess
-how many guesses it takes to guess it
3.vectors
4. sorting names, sort all the characters 
not just the first value


EXTRA CREDIT-Sorting problem
none acceptable characters
Ideas
Possible selection sort function

Questions/Concerns:
1.2D array for table?
2.Fix check Function. I need it to repeat only if false, not working right
3.toupper used in search?-->verify if you need another options array
4.vector syntax-->fix/finished
